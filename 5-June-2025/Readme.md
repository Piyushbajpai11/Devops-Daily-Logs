# 🚀 DevOps Journey Kickoff – June 5, 2025

Today I officially begin my **6-month DevOps Roadmap** with a daily commitment.

## ✅ What I Did:
- Created this repository: `devops-daily-log`
- Structured it to track daily progress (by date and topic)
- Wrote down goals and how I'll use this to stay consistent and public

## 📌 Goal:
To compelete DevOps basics with certs by Dec 2025 by learning, building, documenting, and sharing every day.

## 🔥 Motivation:
I'm fully committed to switching my tech path from just full stack to DevOps + Cloud. This repo is my public log — a way to stay consistent and accountable.

## 🛠️ Tools/Setup:
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Linux (WSL/Ubuntu)
- Terminal/Zsh

## Next Step:
Start with Linux commands and Git basics tomorrow.
